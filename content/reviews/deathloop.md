**Deathloop** In Deathloop, the player takes on the role of Colt, an assassin stuck in a time loop who has been tasked to take out eight targets called Visionaries across the island of Blackreef before midnight, as leaving even one alive will cause the time loop to reset and undo his work. Should Colt die before taking out the eight targets, he will wake back up at the start of the loop The player uses a combination of stealth, parkour, attack skills, guns, gadgets, and powers as in Arkane's previous games Dishonored and Prey to move about the game world.

They must avoid or take out guards, learn the patterns of Colt's targets, and figure out the right order to eliminate said targets using guns, melee attacks, or other environmental means.
